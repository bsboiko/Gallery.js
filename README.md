## Gallery.js

#### Photo Viewer for the web


#### Note

This project used the ImageControls.js library for its controls. This is currently not available, but as soon as it is made public this library will be updated to reflect that information. Until then, this library is not usable.

#### Running Locally

Since this using CDNs and images, you'll have a little issue running this locally. A quick fix is to run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` on the directory with your content. You could of course create an Apache server or whatever you like and that would work just fine.
